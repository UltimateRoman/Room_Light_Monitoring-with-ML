# Room_Light_Monitoring-with-ML

This is a room light monitoring and alert system with a Bolt WiFi Module(ESP8266) using a light sensor(LDR).

The system is made intelligent and efficient by deploying Machine Learning with Anomaly Detection.
A Z-Score Analysis Algorithm is executed to dynamically define thresholds for the light intensity data read continously by the light sensor.
When there is an abrupt change in light intensity such as when a person switches on or off the lights of a room suddenly, the system understands this to be an anomaly and immediately alerts the user via an SMS.
